# Student Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a Students Performance dataset to identify gender differences, study habits, and factors influencing grades. It also applies machine learning techniques such as feature selection, PCA, and XGBoost to predict student performance.

## Key Insights

- Comparison of failure rates between boys and girls.
- Strong influence of attendance, project work, and notes-taking on grades.
- Dimensionality reduction with PCA improved interpretability of selected features.

## Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- scikit-learn (preprocessing, feature selection, PCA, metrics)
- XGBoost (classification)
